# Konkarong - Task and Expense Manager

## Overview

This project is a full-stack web application that combines a Task Management System with an Expense Tracker. It provides users with the ability to manage tasks, track expenses, and maintain a comprehensive view of their productivity and financial activities.

## Features

- **Task Management:**
  - Create, edit, and delete tasks.
  - Assign tasks to team members.
  - Set deadlines and track task progress.

- **Expense Tracking:**
  - Log and categorize expenses.
  - Generate reports to analyze spending patterns.
  - Set budget goals and receive notifications.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **React.js:**
  - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - Efficiently renders components and manages the application state.

- **State Management:**
  - Utilizes React Context API for state management.

- **Styling:**
  - Uses Material-UI for a modern and responsive UI design.

### Backend

- **ASP.NET Core:**
  - A cross-platform, high-performance framework for building modern web applications.

- **Database:**
  - Utilizes Entity Framework Core with SQL Server for data storage.

- **Authentication:**
  - Implements JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication.

- **API Documentation:**
  - Includes Swagger/OpenAPI for clear API documentation.

### Hosting

- **Frontend Hosting:**
  - Deploy the React.js application to a static hosting service such as Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.

- **Backend Hosting:**
  - Deploy the ASP.NET Core application to a cloud platform like Azure, AWS, or Heroku.
  - Set up a production-ready database, and update the connection string accordingly.

### Testing

- **Unit Testing:**
  - Utilize testing frameworks like xUnit or NUnit for backend unit tests.
  - Use Jest for frontend unit testing.

- **Integration Testing:**
  - Conduct integration testing to ensure seamless interaction between frontend and backend components.

- **End-to-End Testing:**
  - Implement end-to-end testing using tools like Cypress for a comprehensive validation of your application.

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

- Set up a CI/CD pipeline using tools like Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI/CD.
- Automate the build and deployment processes for a streamlined development workflow.

### Monitoring and Logging

- Implement monitoring solutions such as Application Insights (Azure) or ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for tracking application performance.
- Configure logging to capture and analyze runtime information, errors, and exceptions.

### Advanced Topics

- Explore containerization with Docker for both frontend and backend components.
- If applicable, consider container orchestration tools like Kubernetes for managing the application in a production environment.

## Getting Started
